# Safety net for Phase 2 dataset/month merges. Without this, one slow or
# stuck group (confirmed live: the largest DLPD source workbook, 700+MB)
# blocks the ENTIRE ETL job forever -- every other dataset/month that
# would otherwise merge cleanly never gets a chance, and the dashboard
# never gets any real data at all. A merge that runs past this many
# seconds is quarantined (same as a merge that raises an exception) so
# the loop moves on to the next group instead of hanging indefinitely.
#
# Each group gets its OWN single-worker executor (see
# _run_group_merge_with_timeout below) instead of sharing one pool.
# A shared, small pool is actively dangerous here: if a merge is a true
# hang (not just slow) rather than a raised exception, timing out our
# wait on it does NOT stop the underlying thread -- it keeps occupying a
# worker slot forever. With N groups genuinely capable of hanging and
# only a couple of shared workers, the pool fills with zombies after the
# first couple of timeouts and every later group's task then queues
# behind them, waiting the full timeout without ever actually starting
# -- from the outside this looks identical to "every remaining group is
# also stuck", potentially multiplying the timeout by the number of
# remaining groups instead of bounding total time at all. A dedicated
# executor per call means a zombie thread can only ever block its own
# call, never anyone else's.
#
# IMPORTANT, confirmed live 2026-08-31: a dedicated executor stops a
# zombie from blocking OTHER groups, but Python cannot forcibly kill a
# running thread -- executor.shutdown(wait=False) abandons it, it does
# not stop it. A group that is merely slow (not hung) keeps consuming
# real CPU/RAM in the background for as long as it takes to finish, even
# after being "quarantined" and even though the orchestrator has already
# moved on. On this host's 0.1-0.5 vCPU / 512MB, a too-short timeout is
# actively self-defeating: ANEV month 202605 alone streamed >1.4M rows
# (confirmed via live logs) making genuine steady progress the whole
# time, well past the previous 1200s (20min) cap -- so it kept getting
# quarantined and re-abandoned roughly every 20 minutes while the prior
# abandoned attempt(s) kept running in the background too, each new one
# competing with the leftover ones for the same razor-thin CPU/RAM quota.
# That pile-up is the most likely explanation for the job looking frozen
# for ~2 hours (job status only advances on a group SUCCEEDING, so a
# string of quarantine cycles is invisible from progress/updated_at
# alone) and then the container crashing outright. Raised from 1200 to
# 5400 (90min) so a group that is genuinely just slow -- not hung -- gets
# enough room to actually finish and checkpoint instead of being
# repeatedly abandoned into a resource-competing zombie. Still finite, so
# a truly hung merge is eventually quarantined rather than blocking the
# job forever.

    Coordinate architecture
    ------------------------
    TO_PRABAYAR.xlsx and TO_PASCABAYAR.xlsx are fixed coordinate
    master files.

    They:

    - have month=None;
    - are never exported as customer_location_None.parquet;
    - are used to build CUSTOMER_LOCATION for every business month;
    - are the authoritative coordinate source;
    - are joined to DLPD using IDPEL.

    IMPORTANT:

    CUSTOMER_LOCATION must be created BEFORE DLPD is processed.

    Therefore the orchestrator intentionally uses two phases:

        PHASE 1
            Build customer_location_<month>.parquet

        PHASE 2
            Process DLPD / ANEV / PENGECEKAN / other datasets

    This guarantees that MonthlyMerger._enrich_with_coordinates()
    can load the coordinate master when processing DLPD.

            # intended to make a RESUMED run (crashed partway through Phase
            # 1/2) skip work it had already finished. But this checkpoint is
            # DURABLE (persisted to S3/DB per job_id by
            # durable_etl_checkpoint.py, restored even on a brand new
            # GitHub Actions runner with empty local disk), so
            # deliberately RE-TRIGGERING the same job_id after a code fix
            # -- the normal way to regenerate data, e.g. via
            # .github/etl-jobs/<job_id>.json -- silently skipped rebuilding
            # the warehouse too, because an EARLIER run of this job_id had
            # already set the flag. On a fresh runner nothing had called
            # Warehouse.connect() this run (skipped), so no local
            # warehouse.duckdb existed at all, and persist_processed_data()
            # below only uploads it `if WAREHOUSE.exists()` locally -- so
            # the STALE warehouse.duckdb already in S3 (e.g. built from an
            # older fact_anev view definition, from before a same-day
            # correctness fix) was never replaced, even though every
            # dataset's parquet output WAS correctly regenerated and
            # re-uploaded. Every dashboard kept reading that stale view and
            # reproducing the exact bug the re-run was meant to fix.
            #
            # Always rebuild instead. This step is one-shot, well within
            # what a GitHub-hosted runner's ~7GB RAM and up-to-6-hour budget
            # can afford (that headroom is the whole reason this workflow
            # exists -- see etl-merge.yml's own header comment), so there is
            # no real cost to paying for it on every run; the resume-skip
            # optimization only ever saved a rebuild whose correctness this
            # bug then couldn't be trusted anyway. The 512MB production API
            # host's own runtime self-heal (Warehouse.ensure_ready() /
            # connection.py's _ensure_warehouse_tables()) stays as a
